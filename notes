NOTES:

- Inverted rotation around x for some reason
- hist -> "fixed" by using 1-width bin... effectively a 1D histogram

- recording to file not working in URSense.py...
- Increased latitude buffer to 10 mm
- If string sticking out -> sometimes false positives in air -> check neighborhood of each candidate (make it vertical too)

TODO:
- odlaganje s slidingom
- grip verification
- test median across frames & wider latitude cutoff & wider depth bins
- add a limit to workspace in roboApp
