NOTES:

- Inverted rotation around x for some reason
- hist -> "fixed" by using 1-width bin... effectively a 1D histogram

- recording to file not working in URSense.py...
- Increased latitude buffer to 10 mm
- If string sticking out -> sometimes false positives in air -> check neighborhood of each candidate (make it vertical too). If too small discard, but
if all are too small, choose the one with the most.
- If angle steep (sun or heavy load) vision can be bad ---> few points -> does not pass treshold -> also solve /w box somehow?

TODO:
- odlaganje s slidingom
- grip verification
- add a limit to workspace in roboApp -> safety password???
